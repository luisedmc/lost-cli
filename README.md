## About

You just woke up without a clue where you are. Well... the sound of the waves and the smell of the sea are a good hint. I think you're gonna need more information than that to survive. You climb the highest visible tree and look around. You see ... things ... moving around. Monsters! You start to count them and you realize that there are dozens of them. That's not good. But you also see a boat! That's the way out of here! After a while, you draw a map of the island with all your observations skills. You're ready to start your adventure!
